                        <dd>Dema is a city on the continent of Trench. It is surrounded by a large circular wall and has nine towers in the middle. It is also split into nine districts with each district being ruled by its own Bishop. The outside of the city is a necropolis, full of neon gravestones. The city is a very depressive place. The album 'Blurryface' details life in Dema. Citizens are not allowed to leave the city. Dema also has VIP Citizens who receive special treatment from the Bishops. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Sacred Municipality of Dema'.</dd>

                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Clancy</dt>
                        <dd>Clancy is the character played by Tyler. He is a resident of Dema who is famous for writing letters detailing his life in the city. He is also famous as a rebel and member of the Banditos who makes rebellious music. He spent an amount of time a prisoner of Dema being forced to make propaganda, but he has since escaped and is back to being a rebel. He is the only non-bishop who can use psychokinesis.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Nico/Blurryface</dt>
                        <dd>Nico, full name Nicholas Bourbaki (sometimes also known as Blurryface) is the leader of the nine bishops. He is the scariest.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">The Torchbearer</dt>
                        <dd>This is Josh's character. He is a member of the Banditos, and even their leader. His character is very mysterious and has the power to appear elsewhere to guide people without even being physically there.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Keons</dt>
                        <dd>Keons was Clancys bishop. He is described as more kind and caring than the other bishops. He conspired with Ned, the Torchbearer and Clancy to betray Dema and use Trash to free Clancy and get him to Voldsoy. He was killed by the other bishops before being possessed via Psychokinesis by Clancy and starting a fire in dema.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Trash</dt>
                        <dd>Trash the dragon is a sea dragon that is speculated to have been long dead. His body was temporarily possessed via Psychokinesis by Keons to attack the submarine carrying Clancy. He represents creativity.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Ned/Neds</dt>
                        <dd>Ned the individual is a cute little creature living somewhere in a cozy cabin in Trench. His species (who are each individually also known as Ned) as a whole largely resides on Voldsoy. Their antlers can grow and be removed. Once removed they give Clancy the ability to do psychokinesis. Ned stands for 'Neural Expansion Device'.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">The Bishops</dt>
                        <dd>There are nine of them. Blurryface is both Nico and also all of the bishops (and the city) at the same time. Same concept as God being the father and the trinity in Christianity. Clancy theorises they may be immortal beings using psychokineses to swap from body to body. They all borrow their names from Blurryface lyrics. (For example: Sacarver is from 'She's a carver'). Their names are as follows: Nico, Keons, Andre, Lisden, Reusdro, Sacarver, Nills, Vetomo and Listo.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">The Banditos</dt>
                        <dd>The group of rebels who aim to escape/overthrow Dema. They wear yellow tape as the bishops are unable to see the color.</dd>
                        
                        <dt style="color: #ff66b2;">Clancys Rebellion</dt>
                        <dd>A rebellion started by Clancy inside of Dema. They wear red/orange tape to reclaim the color and make themselves known to the bishop.</dd>
